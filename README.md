# Hi there 👋
<p>I am Colombian, Civil Engineer 👷🏻‍♀️ and specialist in Project Management. Three years after finishing my career I started to be curious about software development and I loved it.  Since then I have not stopped learning programming and I am currently studying a technology in Software Development. I feel very happy and I am looking forward to dive into the working field later on. 

I started learning through Youtube and then, while I was working and studying English in the USA, I applied to Shecodes company, which gave me a scholarship to get certified as a web designer. It was an achievement for me taking my first steps in programming. And now I am in the SENA.
